can be a gamechanger for your web app's performance and user experience, we'll see how."

# The Mindset

It's kinda useless going forward without actually explaining how we use to think about the data your
application displays on the browser. Where is this data coming from? Who owns this data?

It is difficult to accept it but "Server state is different from client state" and we need to let that sink in first. *why does it matter??*

Data fetching can be opinionated. Whatever the means may be, we always fetch the latest snapshot of
the data from the server and display it on the web. But, it is the server that owns the data. This may be
a problem when you have already fetched some data and you would like to re-use it for another component, well
you can't do that because your **client-side** application can no way differentiate that these two requests are for
fetching the same data because it doesn't own it.

# Well, Redux?

You might think redux can be pretty useful in this case. We can programmatically state that
these two specific components re-use the same data. We do that by injecting the same props **(mapStateToProps)** 
into both of them.

But, Redux is a fetch once tool. It is not an intelligent data fetching solution. It can no way
tell that, the data you have been using to populate your web app is **stale** and needs to be synced
with the server side data.

# Talking about solutions

One of the earliest solutions that bought a change in this mindset was **apollo-client**. If you have worked
with graphql earlier, I'm sure you might have heard about it. It uses the browser cache to index
the data fetched from the server on the client-side (using keys). You can then re-use this data
across your application. Meaning, if you already have the data, it is fetched from the cache, rather than
making a new network request each time. It will however request for data, when you mark the data on your cache
as **stale**. 

<Blockquote content={`But this was only for graphql, and the keys which were used to index the data were graphql queries. Same
queries could re-use same data from the cache.`} />

Next up, were [swr](https://swr.vercel.app/) and [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/), and these were game-changers. These tools, specifically
react-query bought in the best of **apollo-graphql** into the world of REST API. A vivid comparison of
all these tools can be found on [react-query's documentation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/comparison).

# React Query

React Query indexes data received from the server in your client's cache using keys that you can define, giving
you the control of how your cache looks like. When you integrate react-query, it seems that almost 
everything in your app loads instanteneously. Some of the key features are:

## Stale while revalidate
React query makes your app usable even when new data hasn't been fetched yet. In other cases, you would shoot
up a spinner when your app is fetching data, but with react query new data is fetched in the background while
the user can still use your app.

*Stale data is better than no data at all*.

## Refetching methods
When you use react-query, you are in control, most of the times. Once, the data is fetched, it is cached.
Meaning, you will have even less network networks when you continue to use the app, unless the cache is 
invalidated and marked as **stale**, which again is under your control.

When you configure react-query for the first time, you can specify certain parameters such as **staleTime**
and **retries** to hint react-query how to refetch data and update the cache. It is completely up to you what your stale
time should be, depending upon how frequently your data changes. New data will then be fetched in the
background, and the user will still be seeing stale data on the page. Other options that you
can use to manage your refetch configuration:

- **refetchOnMount**: when useQuery hook mounts, validate the cache.
- **refetchOnWindowFocus**: when user focuses from another tab on the browser or another window, revalidate.
- **refetchOnReconnect**: when you get your network back!!
- **invalidateQueries**: when none of the above work, you can manually invalidate your queries and ask for refetch.
