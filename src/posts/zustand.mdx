description: 'It is very common to use Redux for managing the global state of your React application.
But with Redux comes in so much boilerplate to configure, HOCs and a data flow pattern. What if I told you
that you can leverage all the good features of Redux but without all that boilerplate, using React Hooks.'

# Redux
Why Redux became so popular is because it introduced a maintainable
data flow pattern of generating actions, mutating state using reducers and
effectively applying changes to the subscriber components. I have used
Redux in my projects and I find it extremely useful in the longer
run when the complexity of the app increases.

However, I am a little unhappy about all the configuration you have
to make beforehand.
- configure a store
- persist the store using persist gate
- use redux thunk/saga and middlewares
- wrapping the app in HOCs

# Enter zustand

zustand is a lightweight package which brings in all the good things of Redux
without all the time spent in writing long boilerplate code. It gives you a way to create and consume
your store using React Hooks. You are probably well aware of how
powerful (React Hooks) `ðŸ¦¸ useSuperPowers()` are!

# Creating a store in zustand
```js
  // store/counter.ts 
  import create, { GetState, SetState } from 'zustand'
  import { devtools, persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

  interface Store {
    counter: number,
    updateCounter: (counter: number) => void
  }

  let useStore = (set: SetState<Store>, get: GetState<Store>) => ({
    counter: 0,
    updateCounter: (counter) => {
      set({
        counter
      })
    } 
  })
  useStore = persist(useStore, { name: "counter" })
  useStore = devtools(useStore)

  export const useCounterStore = create<Store>(useStore)
```

and voila! Your store is ready ðŸš€
- We created a custom hook in this file `useCounterStore` which can be reused in your function components as desired.
- zustand provides you `set` and `get` functions to effectively get and set your state values.
- we wrap our useStore instance around two middlewares: persist and devtools. `persist` allows us to persist
our store in the localstorage by default and `devtools` turn on Redux devtools in your dev environment. 

> Notice how we do not have to bind our reducers to the store and write sagas to initiate actions. zustand takes care of all that in the background.

# Consuming a store
In Redux we used to have `connect()` which took mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps as parameters
to hydrate our consumer components. With zustand, it gets even simpler. We can 
just import the store using the hook we created above and we are good to go.

```js
// component.tsx
export default function SomeRandomComponent() {
  const { counter, updateCounter } = useCounterStore();

  return <button onClick={() => updateCounter(counter+1)}>{counter}</button>
}
```
and that's it ðŸš€

# Takeways
As you can see, zustand definitely makes our life easy. We have less time to spend
on configuration and more time to spend on application development. Zustand being `1.9Kb` in size
also solves issues such as the dreaded zombie child problem, react concurrency, and context loss between mixed renderers

> It may be the one state-manager in the React space that gets all of these right.

I guess now it should sound reasonable migrating to ðŸ¦„ &nbsp zustand.
