All I need to care about now is how to create a flawless user login/register experience.'

# Discussing various workflows

There are two ways a user can login/register in my app. Lets focus on the signup part.

## 1. Signup using Email

- Enters email, password and hits the SignUp button
- The client makes a request to the supabase server which does the actual signup process.
- Now as per supabase, all of this user metadata (email, password) has been added to their internal **users** table and now it awaits email confirmation, you cant log in without that.
- Once the email is confirmed, the user can login normally using his credentials.

## 2. Signup using Auth Providers

Users can also signup using auth providers such as Google and Github. Lets use the example of Github in this case.

- Clicks on *"SignIn with Github"* button.
- The client makes a request to the supabase server, here the **redirectTo** url is necessary. It will be used to redirect
to user after a successful sign up. *(Note: For executing a SignUp with Github, your supabase client should be configured on the dashboard properly)*
- On a successful signup, it redirects the user to the provided **redirectTo** url and it appends a **#{access_token}** with the url.
- You can use this access_token to login.

# SignUp Workflow

I was mostly thinking on what to do with redirects and when should you actually login.
I was using a simple Redux utility **zustand**, 
- the major area of concern was *when should I hydrate my user store with user details?*.
- cause my app on load needs a valid **userId** to fetch data from server, else every component would show a *"failed to fetch"*

# Takeaways

The question of *when should I hydrate my user store with user details?* was answered by creating a common sink for all auth providers to
end up before going to my app.
In my case, this component was the *Complete Profile Component*.

In this component, I do all the fetching and updating and all of that stuff but
what matters is I hydrate the store with a valid user, so that when the user is
redirected to the app's homepage, he doesn't have errors but a valid user for whom
data can be fetched!
