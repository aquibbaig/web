# React Hooks: The What
We wont be spending time on how hooks originated and what are function components and all that stuff.
If you want to learn more about it, you can visit [react's documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

Keep one thing in mind, a React Hook is a javascript function that begins with the prefix **use**, is
a **ts/js** file at the source, and typically does not render any JSX. It manages logic such as your application state,
re-rendering, etc. for you.

# Tradeoffs
- From HOCs and class components, your code is now more re-usable and the size is significantly
less
- You can create your own custom hooks, which is a game changer
- You can integrate multiple hooks within one, opening up endless possibilities
- You need to follow rules of hooks, which can be a bummer at times

# Show me some code
Lets start off with the most frequently used hooks in React applications.

# useState hook

**useState** is the simplest react hook which is used to manage component state. 

When you invoke this hook, you get two things
- a variable which stores the current state value
- a function which can be used to update that value

<Code codeClass="language-js" content={`import React, { useState } from "react";
export default function App() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  
  console.log("re-renders");
  return (
    <div className="App">{counter}
      <button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
})`} />

<mark>Remember: whenever the value of this variable changes, your component will re-render. When, you
click on the button each time, the variable updates and the component re-renders</mark>

# useReducer hook
useReducer is logically similar to useState but use useReducer in two cases: 1. when your state is complex, 2. 
when next state depends on the previous state and multiple keys of the current state need
updates.

When you invoke **useReducer**, it gives you the following
- a variable to keep track of current state
- a *dispatch function* to update the state

<mark>Remember: when you write useState when updating your state by changing multiple keys of the
state object, your component may re-render multiple times. In that case, the dispatch function from useReducer
guarantees React that the identity is stable and doesn't need a re-render.</mark>

<Code codeClass="language-js" content={String(`import React, { useReducer } from "react";
function updater(state) {
  return state + 1;
}
export default function App() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useReducer(updater, 0);
  console.log("re-renders");
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {counter}
      <button onClick={() => setCounter()}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}`)} />

# useEffect hook
A **side effect** is something that occurs outside the boundaries of the component you are currently
in. Such effects should not be managed in the function component, instead use the **useEffect**
hook.

It takes in two things in its declaration: 1. a function as argument, 2. a dependency list.

<mark>Remember: The function passed to this hook will run each time either of the values
in it's dependency list updates. If there is no dependency list provided, it runs on the
first render phase only.</mark>

<Code codeClass="language-js" content={String(`import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
export default function App() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("(useEffect)this function runs on each render");
  }, [counter]);
  console.log("(useState) re-renders when state var is set");
  
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {counter}
      <button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}`)} />

# useMemo hook
Performance optimisation, The one thing I love to invest time on. **useMemo** can come in
handy when you need to tell React not to perform large computations again when its result is already
available in memory when we computed it earlier, please just reuse it. This small optimisation
can prevent significantly slow page load times.

It's invocation includes two things, similar to useEffect
- a function to optimise on
- a dependency array that states when the result needs to be recomputed

<mark>Remember that if you want your component to not re-render multiple times when props
  are same, you can wrap it around React.memo() hook, that's different from useMemo.
</mark>

Do not use side effects in useMemo, those belong in useEffect.

# useCallback hook
useCallback is mostly similar to useMemo, even useCallback(fn, deps) is equivalent to useMemo(() => fn, deps).
It returns a memoized version of the callback. 

If you have certain function to be used inside a useMemo function, wrapping those deps around a useCallback makes sense to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
It tells React that to be memoized values, not triggering a re-render.

useMemo and useCallback are hard to reproduce on a sandbox, it will only make sense if you
come across these cases in a real world scenario.
